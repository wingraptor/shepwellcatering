Founded in 2017, Artisan Beards has one simple goal: to introduce quality hand-crafted beard oils to the Barbadian market.

We do things differently:
1. This website is our primary sales channel. This enables us to keep operating costs low so that we can offer our products at affordable prices.
2. All oils are blended by its founder who has a degree in medicinal and biological chemistry and a natural affinity for experimentation. Our oils are blended on demand or in very small batches which allows us to tweak our blends according to your feedback or unique preferences. 
3. We take all feedback seriously. No really, your likes and dislikes will all be carefully considered and used to improve our products and services; it's a win-win. Please visit this [link](https://form.jotform.co/73335034582858) to give your feedback.
4. In addition to our beard oils we have a blog where we share useful tips about how to take care of your beard. 

Thanks for visiting our store and we hope that you enjoy using Artisan Beards' products as much as we enjoy making them!
