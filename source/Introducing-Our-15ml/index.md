We at Artisan Beards recognize that not everyone has a caveman beard 🧔🏾 worthy of soaking up 30ml of our beard oil anytime in this century. Because of this we have launched a 15ml /(1/2oz) bottle which contains 1/2 the volume (quick maths 🔥) of our previous offering.

Does size matter 😰? Well in this case no😌, because despite their small size, these bottles still contain ~300 drops of oil 💦 which will last approximately ~ 50 days with average use.

In addition to only being $18, these oils are also a great way to get your feet and beard w....oiled when it comes to beard care and grooming.
Other advantages include: 

- Being able to carry around these beard oils in your wallet🤑.
- Making people wonder why you're putting eye drops in your beard 👀.
- Proving that big things really come in small packages🍆.

Our 15ml bottles are available right now, just visit any of our product <a href="/#shop">pages </a>and place your order.
