This invigorating blend of jojoba, argan and almond oils is bursting with a citrusy fragrance and subtle peppermint undertones. 

This is a great daytime oil due to its light feel and refreshing scent. The addition of tea tree oil is great for getting rid of beardruff and imbues anti-fungal properties. This oil is an excellent moisturizer which is ideal for soothing irritated, scratchy skin.

<em>Note that our 0.5oz (15ml) bottles contain enough for ~300 drops of oil. This will last ~50 days or just over 3 months with 6 drops used per day. Click<a href="/All-About-Beard-Oils/"> here </a>for more info.</em>
