This oil is a rich blend of sweet almond, jojoba and apricot kernel oils with deep aromas of lavender, rosemary and the woodsy cedarwood oil. 

The three carrier oils in this mixture are excellent moisturizers that help to soften the beard and prevent hair breakage. Rosemary and cedarwood oils both have hair growth stimulating properties and can assist with growing facial hair. Lavender oil on the other hand has an amazing aroma that really adds to the appeal of this oil.

You can use this oil at anytime but it is especially great at night due to its slightly thicker consistency and richer aroma compared with our <a href="/2018/11/27/citrusMint30/">Refreshing Citrus Mint Oil.</a> 

Ultimately nothing can beat genetics when it comes to growing a full beard. However, proper beard care including using this beard oil can help your beard reach its true potential.

<em>Note that our 1oz (30ml) bottles contain enough for ~600 drops of oil. This will last ~100 days or just over 3 months with 6 drops used per day. Click<a href="/All-About-Beard-Oils/"> here </a>for more info.</em>
