Some of you may be wondering what are beard oils, should I be using one, and which oil should I use. In this blog post I hope to answer all of these questions.

## What is a Beard Oil?

Put simply, a beard oil is mixture of natural oils and fragrances that when applied to a beard help to moisturize the beard hair and underlying skin. Depending on the specific blend these oils have the potential to stimulate hair growth, reduce dandruff, prevent breakage, remove tangles, reduce scratchiness and increase overall fullness of one's beard.
Aromatic compounds (think 'aroma') present in beard oil blends not only smell good but also have anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties. In short these compounds make your beard smell good. 

## Who is a Beard Oil For?  

Beard oils are for all men who want to have well-groomed facial hair. Having a full facial hair has (once again) become accepted and beard oils are just one tool that should be in all men's grooming toolkit.

## What Beard Oil Should I Choose?

Let me start by saying that there is no right or wrong beard. As stated previously all beard oils moisturize the beard and underlying skin so choosing a beard oil therefore depends on other factors: 

- **Allergies/Sensitivities**: This one is obvious but you should not choose a beard oil that contains ingredients that you are allergic or sensitive to. If unsure, just apply a small amount of beard oil to your beard, wait 5 mins and look out for burning sensations or redness/swelling. If irritation continues please wash these oils out of your beard with soap and water and discontinue use of that product. 

- **Beard Goals**: If you goal is to get rid of beardruff then our <a href="/2018/11/27/citrusMint30/">Refreshing Citrus Mint Beard Oil</a> is perfect you. If you are looking to enhance beard growth then I recommend <a href="/2018/11/25/beardGrower30/">The Beard Grower</a>.

- **Fragrance**: Every beard oil blend will have a unique fragrance and of course everyone will have their own personal preference.

- **Time of Day**: This one is a little less obvious but time of day can influence the beard oil that you use. Lighter oils are more suited for daytime use as they just feel better on the skin in our humid climate. Thicker oils, however, are better for night-time use as they keep the beard and skin moisturized in the cooler night air. This factor, however, shouldn't play a major role in your selection of beard oil. 

## How Do I Apply Beard Oils?

Applying beard oils is easy just apply a few drops (See section below) to your clean hands, rub them together then massage them into your cleaned beard. I personally apply a beard oil after hopping out of the shower and drying my beard with a towel. 

## How Much Beard Oil Should I Use?

You need to use a surprisingly small amount of beard oil on each application to see results; consistency is much more important. Most guys will only have to use 6 drops of oil per application per day.
The amount of beard oil that you need to use is dependent on the amount of beard that you have.

Here are the recommended dosages:

1. **1 month growth**: 3-4 drops per day
2. **2-3 months growth**: 4-6 drops per day
3. **4-12 months growth**: 6-10 drops per day
4. **Cave man**: the whole bottle! nah, just kidding; use 10+ drops per day

Note that our 1oz (30ml) bottles contain enough for ~600 drops of oil or will last 100 days; just over 3 months with 6 drops use per day.
